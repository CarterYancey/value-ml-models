# Decision log, from 2026-09-29

On 2026-09-29 Carter lifted the stop rules of [agents.md](../agents.md)
for the time being and asked that every decision be logged. This is
that log: one numbered entry per decision, newest last, with the
reason and what it rests on. Results are in the
[logbook](../logbook.md) and the notes it links to.

Not lifted, and kept: the hard invariants of CLAUDE.md (no local
splits, no feature engineering, the sealed holdout, era-sliced
reporting, reproducible runs), the branch workflow, and the rules
under "Before writing a conclusion". No holdout look, promotion, pull
request into `Claude` or deployment is made under this log.

## The goal, in Carter's words (2026-09-29)

A model capable of making a few high-precision selections that have
low risk and plenty of upside potential (value picks). The thesis of
the project: a high precision on a modest target can outperform the
market over the long term by avoiding big losers. Carter's
simulations elsewhere support it, depending on (1) a precision of
about 0.65 or more, (2) the era: such strategies outperform during
and after market drawdowns, (3) the variance of the returns of the
picks.

Carter's reading of the label rungs: the lower drawdown of the picks
suggests fewer losers, so an excess CAGR that is no higher must mean
too little recall on big winners.

## What a result is judged on from here

In this order: what the picks went on to do (losers, big winners,
excess CAGR, drawdown), by entry year; the precision on the label
against 0.65; then PR-AUC and p@20 for ranking candidates inside one
cell. The pick-outcome screen stays a screen: no costs, equal
weights, top K rows per year.

## Decisions

### 1. Measure the tails of the picks before searching parameters

*Decided:* run `baseline_pick_anatomy_3y` and `forest_pick_anatomy_3y`
ahead of the three parameter searches.

*Why:* Carter's reading is a hypothesis about the distribution of
the picks' returns, and mean and median cannot test it. Label
expressions as pick outcomes give the tails with no code change:
the share of picks with `fwd_3y_cagr < 0`, `< -0.1`, `>= 0.15`,
`>= 0.25`, a drawdown from entry of 0.4 or more, and an excess CAGR
of 0.05 or more. The rungs showed that thresholds of one kind of
label do not move the picks' outcomes, so the forest sweep changes
the kind of label (absolute, relative, "not a loser") and the
columns (all ranks, fundamentals only), the two things that might.
top_k gains 5 and 10 because the goal is a few selections.

*Cost:* 4 + 18 runs, about 2.5 hours. 7 configurations added to the
primary cell.

### 2. Put pick outcomes in the three parameter searches

*Decided:* `pick_outcomes` (the four of the rungs and the six tails)
and `top_k = [20, 10, 5, 50]` are added to
`{forest,lgbm,xgb}_random_search_dd_entry_3y`. None had run, so the
files are edited, not copied.

*Why:* proposed in the
[rungs note](2026-09-29-label-rungs-dd-entry.md): PR-AUC and p@20
moved across the rungs without the picks' outcomes moving, so a
search read on PR-AUC alone can only find a better predictor of the
label. The searches still rank on PR-AUC; the outcomes are read
beside it.

### 3. The searches stay queued, behind the anatomy sweeps

*Decided:* not dropped, not run first. Their cell and feature set
may change with what decision 1 finds; they are re-examined when it
has been read.
